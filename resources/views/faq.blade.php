                        <p><b>I have data from a GeoMx experiment. Can I analyze it with
                                spatialGE?</b></p>

                        <p>Yes, you can. spatialGE can be applied to any spatially-resolved transcriptomics experiment
                            as long as gene counts are associated to x and y coordinates within a tissue sample. Some of
                            the methods in spatialGE have been designed to analyze spatial data that is densely sampled,
                            and most GeoMx experiments are characterized by ROI-based sampling that often is sparse and
                            targeting tissue compartments. As a result, some methods would not yield insightful results.
                            For example, while creating a gene expression surface (interpolation) based on 20 ROIs
                            across a large tissue section is possible, it would likely not be informative.</p>

                        <p><b>Do I have to pay to use spatialGE?</b></p>

                        <p>No, spatialGE is open to the research community. Development of spatialGE has been funded by
                            NIH grants (T32 CA 233399 and U01 CA 274489). Users are only required to create an account,
                            and to acknowledge its use by citing the research articles that describes the methods in
                            spatialGE:</p>

                        <p><b>What does spatialGE do with my data?</b></p>

                        <p>Any sample data you upload to spatialGE can only be accessed using your credentials.</p>


                        <p><b>Is it normal for some methods in spatialGE to take long time to complete?</b></p>

                        <p>Some methods implemented in spatialGE are memory and computing intensive (e.g., spatial
                            differential expression, gene expression surface generation). The methods in spatialGE use R
                            code to conduct analyses (code available here), which could be downloaded and installed to
                            use via command-line requiring basic knowledge of R programming. Should the user choose to
                            use the spatialGE web app, when running an analysis, the user is prompted to select to
                            receive an email notifying when an analysis is complete. Once the analysis is started and an
                            email notification selected, the user can close spatialGE and them process will keep
                            running.</p>


                        <p><b>How many analyses can I run at the same time?</b></p>

                        <p>Because spatialGE is a free tool open to the public, you can only run one analysis at a time. A maximum number of users can run analyses concurrently, when that number is reached, any additional analyses will be queued until enough resources are available</p>
